# VU1-Monitor

A CLI application for monitoring hardware using [VU1 Dials](https://streacom.com/products/vu1-dynamic-analogue-dials/)

## What is this?

The VU1 Dials come with a server application and demo monitoring app out of the box. The Demo app is set up to work on Windows machines only. This application fills this gap for both MacOS and Linux users that want to monitor their hardware using the VU1 Dials.

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

To install `vu1-monitor` it is recommended to use `pipx` to instal the tool.

`pipx` is used to install Python CLI applications globally while still isolating them in virtual environments. `pipx` will manage upgrades and uninstalls of `vu1-monitor`. If `pipx` is not already installed, you can follow any of the options in the official [pipx installation instructions](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/).
